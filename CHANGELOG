== 0.1.3 - The little fairy release

* You can use an absolute URL with scheme and all instead of path-only abbreviation
* You can now assign a URL-encoded payload instead of a hash when doing all requests
  except of a GET. This to be nice to people building web-service backends.
* Be nice to the folks that do not use the database or sessions
* we have @assigns to access the instance variables summoned in the controller 
* follow_redirect makes use of the feature below, accordingly
* You can now pass verbatim query string parameters like so
    get "/blog/archive?page=2"
  which will be conveniently mixed with other params (and can also be used when doing POSTs!)
* Rdoc is extremely unfriendly to pluses and stars in Unicode mode. They should be punished.
* FunctionalTest is now WebTest and UnitTest is now ModelTest, because the ruby sadists said they shall be.
* We now support proper, infinitely nested and encapsulated parameters
  * for querystrings
  * for postvars
  * and yes, for uploads too
* On that note, added a Mosquito::MockUpload to quickly simulate an uploaded file. The file will be filled with random text, so roll your own if you need concrete file content.
* We are Camping 1.5 compatible
* You can now do 'test "should do this"' and pass a block of assertions.
* More tests for better coverage of mosquito.rb
* Cleanup of Rakefile with other options and proper CHANGELOG inclusion:CHANGELOG
